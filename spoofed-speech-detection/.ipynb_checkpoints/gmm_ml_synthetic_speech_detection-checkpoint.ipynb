    "# Spoofed Speech Detection via Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Gaussian Mixture Models\n",
    "The goal of synthetic speech detection is to determine whether a speech segment $S$ is natural or synthetic/converted speeach.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a Gaussian mixture model maximum likelihood (GMM-ML) classifier for synthetic (spoofed) speech detection. This approach uses regular mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features and gives the best performance on the [ASVspoof 2015 dataset](https://www.idiap.ch/dataset/avspoof) among the standard classifiers (GMM-SV, GMM-UBM, ...). For more background information see: *HanilÃ§i, Cemal, Tomi Kinnunen, Md Sahidullah, and Aleksandr Sizov. \"Classifiers for synthetic speech detection: a comparison.\" In INTERSPEECH 2015*. The scripts use the Python package [Bob.Bio.SPEAR 2.04](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bob.bio.spear/2.0.4) for speaker recogntion.\n",
